# Rules of the Halloween Monster Game

## Core Idea
Players earn **Victory Points (VP)** by killing monsters on a shared battlefield
delimited by two dashed lines. Each round, every player secretly chooses one action
(usually: attack a monster with one of their weapons).

Key concepts:

- **Victory Points (VP)**: used to determine the final ranking.
- **Health Points (HP)**: represent a player's current life/strength.
- **Damage Points (DP)**: damage dealt by weapons.
- **Weapons**: basic or special, each with its own DP and effects.
- **Coins**: currency used to buy bonuses.

At the end of a round:

- It is announced which monsters were killed and by whom.
- The remaining HP of surviving monsters is **not** publicly revealed.

## Set up
At the start of the game, each player receives:

1. **A basic weapon (Dagger)**: deals 3 DP.
2. **A fixed amount of HP** (e.g. 5 or 8, to be defined).

Players may form alliances of up to **3 players** (configurable). Alliances are **fixed**: they cannot be expanded or dissolved during the game. Players in the same alliance **may swap HP and weapons** during the appropriate phase (see Phase 1).
(*Optional rule: HP may be adjusted depending on whether a player is solo or in an alliance.*)

## Monsters & Rewards

There are multiple types of monsters, each with:

- **HP** (Health Points)
- **Reward** when killed: include monsters' HP and may include special weapons, and/or VP.

### Type of Monster 
- **Gobelin**
- **Sorciere**
- **Géant**

*Other Monsters ...*
### Special Weapons 
Those weapon deals specific number of damages in specific ways
    - ***Double épée***: 4 DP total. Either 4 DP on one target, or 2 DP + 2 DP on two targets.
    - ***Bombe***: 
    - ***Poison***: 

## Phase of the Game

Each round is divided into three phases.

### Phase 1 — Discussion & Swapping

- Players can discuss strategy (global chat, private chats, alliance chats).
- Members of the same alliance may:
  - transfer HP,
  - exchange weapons.
- At the end of this phase, the **turn order** is determined:
  - Players are sorted by **current HP** (highest HP acts first).
  - Ties are resolved randomly.

### Phase 2 — Planning & Attacks

- Each player secretly chooses:
  - **which monster** to attack,
  - **which weapon** to use among their own weapons.
- No swapping is allowed in this phase (only in Phase 1).
- All chosen actions are locked in, then resolved.

Special rule:

- If a monster is killed before later attacks are applied:
  - Attacks targeting this monster are redirected to the **monster** that take this spot in the waiting list.
  - If there is no monster available, the attack **fails**.
- During this phase, players may also spend **Coins** to buy bonuses such as:
  - **Clairvoyance**: Enable to see the health of the monster at during any phase 1
  - **Swap**: Can swap the player turn in the order
  - **Craft**: Forge any weapon
  - *Other effects (to be defined)*.

### Phase 3 — Resolution & Update

- All attacks are resolved according to the turn order and weapon effects.
- For each monster:
  - If its HP drops to 0 or below:
    - the player who dealt the **final blow** is announced,
    - that player receives the associated rewards (HP, special weapons, VP).
- Public information:
  - Which monsters died and who killed them.
- Hidden information:
  - Exact remaining HP of surviving monsters. Can be access with **Clairvoyance**
- A new round starts with updated monsters, HP, weapons, and VP.

## Victory Conditions
- Reaching a specific number of VP
    - If a players is in an alliance, they all need to reach that specific number of points
